    <string name="help_message">The progress ring displays a PRating (Productivity rating).\n\nYour PRating
        is determined by \n\nâ€¢ <b>How many of the tasks you completed for the day as well as each of their individual weights.</b>
        \n\nAs long as you finish all of your daily tasks before the day ends, you will recieve a 100% PRating.
        \n\nThe weight of a goal defines how much of an impact that goal has on the PRating. Each goal will start at a weight of 1 and can never drop any lower than that. However,
        If you fail to finish a goal for the day, that goal\'s weight will go up by 1 and will have a greater effect on the PRating
        than the other goals. The weight will continue to go up each day until you finish that certain task in which case, the weight will go down by 1.\n\nYour
        overall goal is to properly finish every task daily to achieve a full PRating and to try to keep each task weight as low as possible.\n\nAlongside this, all of your
        individual times, total times spent daily, and PRatings will be recorded every day and viewable so you will be able to
        recognize patterns or set goals for the future. Good luck! And let\'s have another productive day! :)</string>
